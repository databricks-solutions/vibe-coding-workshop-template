- [ ] `domain` field in each YAML matches folder name
- [ ] **Lineage documentation for EVERY column**

- [ ] **Transformation logic documented** (explicit SQL/PySpark)

---

## Column-Level Lineage

- [ ] Bronze source table/column documented for every column

- [ ] All tables included
- [ ] Complete Bronze → Silver → Gold mapping
- [ ] Transformation summary per table
- [ ] Sample query patterns provided
- [ ] Column mapping guidance for merge scripts

---

## Column Lineage CSV (MANDATORY)

- [ ] CSV validated against YAML for consistency
- [ ] No missing Bronze/Silver source mappings (except generated columns)

---

## Source Table Mapping (MANDATORY)

- [ ] Every row has a rationale explaining the decision
- [ ] INCLUDED tables map to specific Gold tables
- [ ] EXCLUDED tables have standard exclusion rationale
- [ ] PLANNED tables have phase assignments
- [ ] Coverage percentage calculated and documented

---

## Business Onboarding Guide (MANDATORY)

- [ ] `docs/BUSINESS_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md` created
- [ ] Introduction to Business Domain section complete
- [ ] Business Lifecycle diagram included
- [ ] Key Business Entities explained
- [ ] Gold Layer Data Model overview provided
- [ ] **Business Processes section includes ALL major processes**
- [ ] **Each process has Source → Gold table mapping**
- [ ] **Each process has ASCII flow diagram**
- [ ] **Section 5B: Real-World Stories included (minimum 3 stories)**
- [ ] **Each story shows exact table updates at each stage**
- [ ] Analytics Use Cases documented
- [ ] AI & ML Opportunities section included
- [ ] Genie/Self-Service section included
- [ ] Data Quality & Monitoring section included
- [ ] Getting Started section for each persona

---

## Documentation Standards

- [ ] Every column has dual-purpose description
- [ ] No "LLM:" prefix used (natural dual-purpose format)
- [ ] Business section explains purpose and use cases
- [ ] Technical section explains implementation details
- [ ] SCD strategy documented for each dimension
- [ ] Update frequency documented for each table

---

## Stakeholder Review

- [ ] ERD reviewed with business stakeholders
- [ ] Grain validated for each fact table
- [ ] Measures confirmed complete for reporting needs
- [ ] Naming conventions approved by data governance
- [ ] Data classification verified for each table
- [ ] Design sign-off obtained from business owners

---

## Industry Data Model Alignment (Advisory)

Applies ONLY when `industry_reference_source` ≠ `none`. Advisory — never blocks handoff. Owned by `design-workers/08-industry-alignment`, scored by Validation 6 in `design-workers/07-design-validation`.

- [ ] `context/industry_reference.yaml` manifest present (Mode A: Vibe-generated Silver model reduced; or Mode B: published vertical model)
- [ ] Phase 0 coverage overlay run and folded into the Schema Intake Report
- [ ] `INDUSTRY_CROSSWALK.csv` written with all reference entities (`entity, domain, importance, sensitivity, state, gold_tables, rationale`)
- [ ] Every `core`/`extended` entity is `Covered`, `Absorbed`, `Waived`, or `Planned` (no unresolved `Gap`)
- [ ] Every `Waived`/`Planned`/`Gap` row has a rationale (waivers cross-referenced in `SOURCE_TABLE_MAPPING.csv`)
- [ ] `Covered`/`Absorbed` `gold_tables` exist in the current YAML (no crosswalk drift)
- [ ] Every `PII` industry entity maps to a Gold table carrying a `PII` tag
- [ ] No source-absent industry entity was fabricated as a Gold table (Extract, Don't Generate)
- [ ] `INDUSTRY_ALIGNMENT.md` emitted with the coverage/terminology/PII scorecard
- [ ] `DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` Section 8 records vertical, coverage %, domain/terminology changes, gap dispositions

---

## Cross-Artifact Consistency

- [ ] All columns in ERD exist in YAML
- [ ] All YAML columns exist in COLUMN_LINEAGE.csv
- [ ] All YAML tables exist in SOURCE_TABLE_MAPPING.csv (as INCLUDED)
- [ ] Domain names consistent across ERD, YAML folders, and CSV files
- [ ] Primary key definitions consistent between ERD and YAML
- [ ] Foreign key references valid (target tables exist)
- [ ] Table descriptions in YAML match ERD table names exactly
